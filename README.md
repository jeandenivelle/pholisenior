This is a first implementation of PHOLI. It somewhat
works, and I verified a few proofs in it. 
However, I am not maintaining it any more. The current version
is pholi_nd, started in November 2025. 

This version has too many accumulated design errors, which need to 
be fixed before I can continue towards a more user-friendly calculus. 
The intended calculus evolved from resolution
to natural deduction and it is not well-supported by the
initial data structures.
